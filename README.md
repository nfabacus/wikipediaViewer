This is a simple Wikipedia Viewer, made with React.
This is one of the challenges for FreeCodeCamp programme (https://www.freecodecamp.com/nfabacus).

To make it a bit more challenging for me (so I can learn more), I am going to deploy to Heroku instead of Codepen.

I am starting from almost scratch apart from a skelton.

## Updates
Minimalist Wikipedia Viewer completed.

## How to start the dev server
Just type below in your terminal:
```
./node_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server
```
Then, go to http://localhost:8080/ in your browser.

## Deployment (in Heroku)
Deployed at https://react-wikipedia-viewer.herokuapp.com/
